# Shell-Sort
This Xcode project presents the shell sorting method for sorting arrays of integers. 
The user creates a randomly generated array of integers of the range and size of their
specification, and of either all unique numbers or a completely random set. The array 
is sorted using my interpretation of shell-sort and then pushed to the next screen 
along with the time it took to sort.
